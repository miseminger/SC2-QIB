Attempting to parse dates...
	Using column 'sequence_name' as name. This needs match the taxon names in the tree!!
	Using column 'sample_date' as date.

0.24	TreeTime.reroot: with method or node: least-squares

0.25	TreeTime.reroot: rerooting will ignore covariance and shared ancestry.

1.95	TreeTime.reroot: with method or node: least-squares

1.96	TreeTime.reroot: rerooting will ignore covariance and shared ancestry.
The following leaves don't follow a loose clock and will be ignored in rate estimation:
	_England_NORW-EB706_2020_
	_England_NORW-EF09E_2020_
	_England_NORW-EB7D9_2020_
	_England_NORW-E9850_2020_

 Root-Tip-Regression:
 --rate:	5.663e-04
 --r^2:  	0.12

The R^2 value indicates the fraction of variation inroot-to-tip
distance explained by the sampling times.Higher values corresponds
more clock-like behavior (max 1.0).

The rate is the slope of the best fit of the date tothe root-to-tip
distance and provides an estimate ofthe substitution rate. The rate
needs to be positive!Negative rates suggest an inappropriate root.


The estimated rate and tree correspond to a root date:

--- root-date:	 2019.90


--- re-rooted tree written to 
	clock_results2/rerooted.newick

--- wrote dates and root-to-tip distances to 
	clock_results2/rtt.csv

--- root-to-tip plot saved to  
	clock_results2/root_to_tip_regression.pdf
